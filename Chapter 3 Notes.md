# ***Notes*** Chapter 3: Getting to Know CSS

## The Cascade

Within CSS, all styles cascade from the top of a sheet to the bottom.

[Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/) gave a good explanation of this:

> For example, say we select all paragraph elements at the top of our style sheet and set their background color to orange and their font size to 24 pixels. Then towards the bottom of our style sheet, we select all paragraph elements again and set their background color to green, as seen here.
